C - Static libraries

TASKS
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create a static library called libmy.a that includes all the functions listed below. If you haven't implemented all of these functions, create empty ones with the correct prototype. Make sure to push your main.h file to your repository, which should contain the prototypes for these functions.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that generates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files in the current directory.
